# belly-button-challenge
**Background**
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUS, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
